# Project-I
A program that reads a CSV file that contains grades for assignments, midterms, and finals for a class of students.

-> At first, you need to have a CSV file called "grades.csv"
here is the data i used in grades.csv:

ID,Name,Surname,Assignment,Midterm,Final 
20221678,Noah,Hall,84,93,82 
20239921,David,White,92,89,87 
20217892,Mia,Moore,87,90,85 
20224567,Jack,Robinson,93,82,88

1- Introduction 

Our project is about a Python program that manages student grades stored in a CSV file. The program reads the grades, calculates total scores, and saves the results back into a new CSV file. 

2- Requirements and Specifications 

The program needs a CSV file with rows for each student and columns for assignments, midterms, and finals. It gives both number and letter grades as output. We made sure the program follows the ideas of being simple, effective and easy to use. 

3- Testing 

We tried out the program a lot using different situations to make sure it works correctly. We tested it with different types of files, even empty ones, and high or low grades to be sure it handles everything right. 

4- Results 

When we used the program with a small set of data, it added the right numeric and letter grade columns to the new CSV file. The program worked well, showing that it can automate the grading process effectively and accurately. 

5- Conclusion 

In short, our program is a solid solution for managing grades from a CSV file. It successfully meets our goals, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling and processing grades accurately.
